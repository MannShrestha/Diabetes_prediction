### Building Diabetes model Prediction

dataset: [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

## Objective:
- Build a model  to predict the progression of diabetic patients based on given data set.
- Run the model in web-app using FastApi

## How to run this project?
1. Clone or download this repository into your local machine.
link : [github](https://github.com/MannShrestha/Diabetes_prediction.git)
2. Install all required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make sure you have jupyter notebook installed, or Anaconda Navigator or VS-code or any IDE
4. Run jupyter notebook and save the model in any format such as .pkl,joblib and so on.
5. Open 'App.py' file in VS code or any other IDE and run it with python interpreter (Fastapi server).
6. Run in terminal: `python app.py`
7. After getting port:5000
- `127.0.0.1/5000`
8. copy the above port number and open new tab in browser and paste that link use:docs to run in FastApi
- `127.0.0.1/5000/docs` 
9. You can also use Postman  to test API.
